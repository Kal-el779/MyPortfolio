# Voody Kalpesh Rao - Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio! This project showcases my skills in **AI / Machine Learning**, **Data Science**, and **Web Development** through an immersive, space-themed interface.

## 🌌 Key Features

### 1. **Interactive Starfield**
- **Sucked into the Void**: A custom-built particle system where background stars are gravitationally pulled towards your cursor when you click and hold.
- **Constellation Network**: Connects stars with lines to form dynamic constellations as you explore.

### 2. ⚫ **"Gargantua" Black Hole Preloader**
- **3D Accretion Disk**: A fully 3D animated black hole inspired by *Interstellar*, featuring a golden accretion disk and a pure black event horizon.
- **Matter Absorption**: Watch as particles of light and matter are sucked into the black hole while the site loads.

### 3. **Modern UI/UX**
- **Glassmorphism**: Sleek, semi-transparent cards and sections.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Performance Optimized**: Uses `IntersectionObserver` for smooth scroll animations without lag.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic structure.
- **CSS3**: Advanced animations, 3D transforms (`preserve-3d`), Flexbox/Grid layout.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Custom Canvas logic for the starfield, particle physics engine, and DOM manipulation.
- **No External Libraries**: Built entirely with Vanilla JS and CSS for maximum performance and learning.

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Kal-el779/MyPortfolio.git
    ```
2.  **Open the project**:
    Navigate to the project folder and open `index.html` in your browser.

    Or use a local server (recommended due to CORS policies on some browsers):
    ```bash
    # using python
    python -m http.server 8000
    ```
